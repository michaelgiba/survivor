# Survivor

*Work in progress / active development*

This project is inspired by [Elimination Game](https://github.com/lechmazur/elimination_game/). It implements the logic described in that codebase, allowing for:

- Executing a simulation of the Survivor game in Python, where players interact with locally served LLMs (using `llama-server` to host Phi-4)
- Visualization of game rollout through WebAssembly/WebGL, implemented in Rust





## Components and Status

- [x] Basic game structure
- [ ] LLM interactions via `llama-server` and Phi-4 inference code
- [ ] WebAssembly/WebGL visualization
- [ ] TBD
