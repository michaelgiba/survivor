# Survivor

This project is inspired by [Elimination Game](https://github.com/lechmazur/elimination_game/). It implements the logic described in that codebase, allowing for:

- Executing a simulation of the Survivor game in Python, where players interact with locally served LLMs (using `llama-server` to host Phi-4 or via GROQ)

This project also demonstrates [plomp](https://github.com/michaelgiba/plomp), a minimal visualization and context management library for LLMs.

You can view the game visualization [here](static/plomp.html).
